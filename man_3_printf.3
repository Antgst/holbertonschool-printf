.SH NAME
_printf \- custom implementation of the C printf function

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"
.PP
.BI "int _printf(const char *" format ", ...);"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B _printf
writes output to the standard output
.RI ( stdout )
under the control of a
.I format
string and a variable number of arguments.

The
.I format
string is composed of zero or more ordinary characters and conversion
specifiers. Ordinary characters are printed as they are. A conversion
specifier starts with the character
.B %
and is followed by a character that specifies how to convert and print
the corresponding argument.

This custom implementation is a simplified version of the standard
.BR printf (3)
function and only supports a limited set of conversion specifiers.

The following conversion specifiers are supported:
.TP
.B %c
Prints a single character.
The corresponding argument is an
.B int
which is converted to an
.B unsigned char
and written.
.TP
.B %s
Prints a null-terminated string.
The corresponding argument is of type
.BR "char *" .
If the argument is
.BR NULL ,
this implementation prints
.BR "(null)" .
.TP
.B %%
Prints a literal
.B %
character. No argument is consumed.
.TP
.B %d
Prints a signed decimal integer.
The corresponding argument is an
.B int
value that is converted to its decimal representation.
.TP
.B %i
Equivalent to
.BR %d ;
prints a signed decimal integer.

.PP
The behavior for any other conversion specifier is undefined in this
implementation and may result in an error or unexpected output.

.PP
Unlike the full standard
.BR printf (3),
this implementation does not handle:
.IP \[bu] 2
Flag characters (such as
.BR + , " " , # , 0 , -
.br
)
.IP \[bu]
Field width
.IP \[bu]
Precision
.IP \[bu]
Length modifiers (such as
.BR l , h
)
.IP \[bu]
Locale-specific formatting

.PP
All output is produced using the low-level
.BR write (2)
system call, usually via helper functions such as
.BR _putchar() .

.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.B _printf
returns the total number of characters written to
.IR stdout .

On failure,
.B _printf
returns
.B -1
and no characters (or only a partial output) may have been written.

Typical error cases include:
.IP \[bu] 2
.I format
is
.BR NULL .
.IP \[bu]
An internal write operation fails.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The following examples illustrate basic usage of
.BR _printf :
.PP
.nf
/* Print a simple string */
_printf("Hello, Holberton!\\n");

/* Print an integer */
_printf("Value: %d\\n", 42);

/* Print a character and a string */
_printf("First letter: %c, word: %s\\n", 'H', "Holberton");

/* Print a literal percent sign */
_printf("Progress: 100%%\\n");
.fi

.SH NOTES
This function is part of an educational project and is not intended
to be a complete or drop-in replacement for the standard library
.BR printf (3)
function.

Its behavior is only guaranteed for the supported conversion
specifiers documented above.
